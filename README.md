# Basic base application for rust cli programs.  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tismith/example-cli-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tismith/example-cli-rs)

## We are using:
* `log` and `stderrlog` for configurable logging macros
* `clap` for commandline argument processing
* `error-chain` for error handling
* `assert_cli` for integration testing

## To do:
* Look at `failure` as it stablizes as a replacement for `error-chain`
